# Mastering Service

Putting a lot of time, money and effort into a music production, just to finish it off with a bad mastering can be heartbreaking.

This website target users (like artists, producers, record labels, etc.) in need of professional mastering of audio files for commercial use.
 

## User Stories

All music program offers a form of master preset for a user. The problem with these plugins and presets are that they don’t consider the character of every individual audio file. Every song doesn’t sound the same or have the same need.
You most lightly end up with a distorted, unleveled file with frequencies popping up throughout the audio file. Then these audio master files get sent to radio/streaming sites/etc. Here the audio files once again get processed by standard presets the publishing platform uses. 

Working with a professional mastering engineer that can handle client’s audio files with the right care and prepared them correctly is priceless. Every project is different. It’s a delicate process between engineer and client. The engineer has to balance the wishes of the client with what is physical possible form the final mix.

The goal with this webpage is to target users in need of professional mastering. To make the Mastering Engineer look appealing to them by showing the variation of music she has worked with as well as providing background information of her. Also explain a little about the process of how to book her, prices and contact information.
